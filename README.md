## Getting Started

This program requires a MIPS assembly environment simulator.
The one used and recommended is
[Mars MIPS Simulator 4.5](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).
The Bitmap Display and Keyboard Simulator provided by Mars are essential
to drive the Assembly code. Specifics regarding their setup are within the
`doodlejump.s` file itself.

## Controls

Use the `j` key to move left, `k` key to move right.
